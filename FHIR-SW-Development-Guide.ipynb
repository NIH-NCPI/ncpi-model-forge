    "\n",
    "- The software development life cycle for the NCPI Project Forge FHIR model\n",
    "- How to extend the existing [NCPI Patient model](https://github.com/ncpi-fhir/ncpi-model-forge/blob/master/site_root/input/resources/profiles/StructureDefinition-ncpi-patient.json) with a new\n",

    "The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process for transforming the needs of an end user into high quality, reliable software that implements the needs of the end user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before describing the SDLC specific to the NCPI Project Forge FHIR model, it  may be useful to review the general SDLC for NCPI (based on CHOP D3b SDLC) projects. There will be some differences in the development tooling and testing frameworks among projects, but the phases below give a good general overview of the NCPI SDLC.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üíª Develop\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Translate requirements to software implementation tasks for developers\n",
    "2. Implement code\n",
    "3. Implement and run unit tests in local dev environment\n",
    "4. Commit code to local feature branch\n",
    "5. Push code to remote feature branch on Github\n",
    "6. Create a Pull Request (PR) on Github\n",
    "7. Team reviews code and submits feedback in Pull Request\n",
    "8. Merge Pull Request to merge feature branch into master branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "NCPI projects use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/features) for version control and collaborative software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching Strategy\n",
    "NCPI projects use the üìò [Gitflow Feature Branch Strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for collaborative development. You can read the details about this branching strategy at the provided link, but here are the important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stable code will be on the master branch. Feature branches come off of master\n",
    "- Each feature branch encapsulates functionality distinct from other feature branches\n",
    "- No more than 1 developer should work on a feature branch\n",
    "- Owner of the feature branch should decide when to merge into the master branch (after PR approval)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- At least one other developer (preferably a repository admin) must approve the Pull Request before it can be merged into the master branch by the feature owner.\n",
    "- The code in the feature branch must pass all of the tests run in continuous integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## üë∑ Continuous Integration (CI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous integration enables developers to integrate new code into a shared repository such as GitHub throughout the day. CI runs in a cloud-based environment and is triggered when a developer pushes their code to Github. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check-out/pull down repository's code from Github \n",
    "2. Build stage - build runtime environment and install dependencies needed to run code\n",
    "3. Test stage - run unit tests\n",
    "4. Test stage - run integration test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build verification - code is built in a fresh environment for every code change\n",
    "- Automating testing - quicker detection and resolution of bugs\n",
    "- Standard, repeatable build and test process\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes code and tests may run successfully on one developer's machine but fail on another due to a difference in runtime environment or a missing dependency in the source code configuration. CI helps catch these sorts of issues quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "NCPI currently uses the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) cloud-based CI platform because it is free and fairly easy to setup for any project. However, GitHub has recently launched their own CI platform, [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) which may be considered for the future since it requires less setup than CircleCI. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üê≥ Continuous Deployment (CD)\n",
    "If the software being developed is something (e.g. web service) that requires infrastructure (e.g. database, web servers, networking, etc) to run then CD will also run after CI completes. The purpose of CD is similiar to that of CI. Just as code must be built and tested, the infrastructure on which the code will run must also be deployed and tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check-out/pull down the code that builds the infrastructure\n",
    "2. Tear down existing infrastructure\n",
    "3. Run the code to deploy the infrastructure\n",
    "4. Run post-deploy tests to ensure successful deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployments\n",
    "NCPI projects (e.g. FHIR server, FHIR data dashboard) which require infrastructure are deployed into [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "When software is deployed, it will be deployed into 1 of 3 environments: `Development`, `Quality Assessment`, or `Production`. Each environment has its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), making services and apps within any one environment unreachable from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named `dev` \n",
    "- Provide an environment primarily for testing infrastructure deployments\n",
    "- Software in feature branches are deployed into `dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named `qa`\n",
    "- Provide a stable environment primarily for integration testing between various services and applications\n",
    "- Software on the master branch is deployed into `qa`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named `prd`\n",
    "- Provides a stable environment with the end-user facing services and apps\n",
    "- Software on the master branch at particular point marked by the release tag is deployed into `prd`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform\n",
    "NCPI projects use a privately hosted [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) instance on AWS to execute the CD pipeline for infrastructure deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì¶ Release\n",
    "Physically, a release is a package of source code with a version which identifies a logical set of content having specific compatibility characteristics. Releases use üìò [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to version the code in the release. The release process may also involve deploying software to production (if infrastructure is required).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general release process for NCPI projects is detailed on the [D3b Release Maker](https://github.com/d3b-center/d3b-release-maker) README. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the important concepts in the release process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The master branch is tagged with the new release version\n",
    "- A GitHub Release is created on GitHub. It contains the release's source code and other assets \n",
    "- The source code on the master branch at the release tag is deployed into production"

    "Before we begin, let's do a quick refresher on some key modeling concepts in FHIR: \n",
    "\n",
    "### FHIR Base Model\n",
    "- FHIR comes with a model for the core FHIR resources (e.g. Patient, Specimen, Observation, etc.)\n",
    "- The phrase \"FHIR Model\" refers to a set of FHIR conformance and terminology resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conformance Resources\n",
    "- An entity in FHIR is called a `Resource`. Examples: `Patient`, `Specimen`, `StructureDefinition`\n",
    "- Types of conformance resources include `StructureDefinition`, `CodeSystem`, `SearchParameter`.\n",
    "- A `StructureDefinition` is essentially a schema. \n",
    "- A `StructureDefinition` can represent the schema for a particular FHIR resource (e.g. Patient) or an attribute  on a FHIR resource (e.g. biological-sex)\n",
    "- A `StructureDefinition` that represents an attribute on a FHIR resource (e.g. biological-sex) is called an Extension\n",
    "- An Extension based `StructureDefinition` is used to add a new attribute to a FHIR resource\n",
    "- A non-Extension based `StructureDefinition` is often called a `profile`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology Resources\n",
    "- A `CodeSystem` is a FHIR resource that represents an ontology\n",
    "- A `CodeSystem` contains concepts and their codes \n",
    "- A `ValueSet` is a restricted set of codes (e.g. `male` | `female`) from one or more `CodeSystems`\n",
    "- A `ValueSet` can be bound to an attribute on a FHIR resource to restrict the values of the attribute\n",

    "At this point we've completed all of the implementation needed to extend our NCPI Patient with a new attribute to capture the patient's species. Now we need to test our FHIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do that let's go over what we mean by \"test\" since it encompasses several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify FHIR model \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to verify that our FHIR model is syntactically and semantically correct according to the FHIR specification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Validate that the FHIR model \n",
    "After we've verified that the FHIR model is constructed properly and follows all of the rules in the FHIR specification, we need to make sure it does what we expect it to. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we create example FHIR resources which make use of the profiles in our FHIR model and then validate them in our test process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Documentation Generation\n",
    "The FHIR specification includes a standard documentation format for FHIR models. The documentation for a FHIR model is in the form of a static site called an `ImplementationGuide`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned in the [Project Forge Repository Layout](#Project-Forge-Repository-Layout) section, the `ncpi-model-forge` repository must follow a certain structure and include certain configuration files in order for the `ImplementationGuide` static site to be built successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "We always want to generate documentation for our model as we develop it and so part of our tests need to ensure that the `ImplementationGuide` will be built successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "The FHIR specification does not have a standard for naming conventions of files or resource IDs. However it is very important to have consistency across all FHIR resources in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Project Forge FHIR model follows these [NCPI Naming Conventions](https://github.com/ncpi-fhir/ncpi-model-forge/blob/master/docs/naming_conventions.md) which are validated as part of testing the FHIR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "üöß This section is coming soon\n",
    "\n",
    "- FHIR model deployment\n",
    "- Search parameter testing\n",
    "- FHIR ingest testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HL7 Validation Tool\n",
    "Most of the testing for the FHIR model (steps 1-3) can be accomplished using the official HL7 FHIR model validation tool called the [HL7 ImplementationGuide Publisher](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation) or `IG Publisher` for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the IG Publisher is not easy to use since it requires special configuration for each resource in the FHIR model. Additionally, the IG Publisher does NOT test that all resource files and IDs follow the NCPI naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NCPI FHIR Utility\n",
    "For these reasons, NCPI has developed a Python command line utility, `fhirutil`, which makes FHIR model validation using the IG Publisher a lot easier. This utility also has a handful of other useful functions which we may use later (e.g. push resources to a FHIR server, version FHIR resources, JSON/XML conversion, etc) "
